# Shoe-Identifier
Machine Learning application being built in Python to identify shoes
It will basically take in images that a user wil take from the IOS app and send it through the python Machine Leanring scripts, which will reference
the data in the server to identify the shoe, and tell the user the name, release date, and retail price, adn much more information regarding the sneaker.

I followed Nicholas Renotte's youtube video and git hub repo to complete this.
