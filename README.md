# Shoe-Identifier
Machine Learning application being built in Python for back-end, Swift for IOS app, and React JS for website, and most likely MongoDB for server.
It will basically take in images that a user wil take from the IOS app and send it through the python Machine Leanring scripts, which will reference
the data in the server to identify the shoe, and tell the user the name, release date, and retail price, adn much more information regarding the sneaker.
This app is meant for the sneaker enthusiasts and community.



*** I will add the Python Machine learning code, which is a jupitor notebook, once that part is completed. ***
